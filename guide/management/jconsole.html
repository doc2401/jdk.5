<h1>Using jconsole</h1>

<p>Jconsole is a JMX-compliant monitoring tool.&nbsp; It uses the
extensive JMX instrumentation of the Java virtual machine to
provide information on performance and resource consumption of
applications running on the Java platform.</p>

<h2><a name="starting" id="starting"></a>Starting jconsole</h2>

<p>The <code>jconsole</code> executable is in
<code><i>JDK_HOME</i>/bin</code>, where
<i><code>JDK_HOME</code></i> is the directory where the JDK is
installed.&nbsp; If this directory is on your system path, you can
start the tool by simply typing <code>jconsole</code> in a command
(shell) prompt. Otherwise, you have to type the full path to the
executable file.</p>

<h3>Command Syntax</h3>

<p>You can use jconsole to monitor both local applications (those
running on the same system as <code>jconsole</code>) and remote applications (those
running on other systems).&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Using <code>jconsole</code> to monitor a local application is useful for development
and prototyping, but is not recommended for production environments,
because <code>jconsole</code> itself consumes significant system
resources.  Remote monitoring is recommended to isolate the
<code>jconsole</code> application from the platform being
monitored.</p>
<p>For a complete reference on <code>jconsole</code> command syntax, see <a href="../../tooldocs/share/jconsole.html">jconsole - Java Monitoring and
Management Console</a>.</p>

<h4>Local Monitoring</h4>
<p>To monitor a local application, it must be running with the same user ID as <code>jconsole</code>.&nbsp; The command syntax to start <code>jconsole</code> for local monitoring is:</p>

<pre>jconsole [<i>processID</i>]</pre>

<p>where <i>processID</i> is the application's process ID (PID). To determine an application's PID:</p>

<ul>
<li>On Unix or Linux systems, use the <code>ps</code> command to
find the PID of <b>java</b>.</li><li>On Windows systems, use Task Manager to find the PID of
<b>java</b> or <b>javaw</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use the <a href="../../tooldocs/share/jps.html">jps</a> command-line utility to determine PIDs.
</p>
<p>For example, if you determined that the process ID of the
<i>Notepad</i> application is 2956, then you would start jconsole as follows:</p>


<pre>jconsole 2956</pre>

<p>Both <code>jconsole</code> and the application must by executed
by the same user name. The management and monitoring system uses
the operating system's file permissions.</p>
<p>If&nbsp; you don't specify a process ID, jconsole will automatically detect
all local Java applications, and display a dialog box that lets you select the one you want to
monitor (see the next section).
</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="agent.html#local">Local JMX Monitoring and Management</a>.</p>

<h4>Remote Monitoring</h4>
<p>To start <code>jconsole</code> for remote monitoring, use this command syntax:</p>

<pre>jconsole [<i>hostName</i>:<i>portNum</i>]</pre>

<p>where <i>hostName</i> is the name of the system running the
application and <i>portNum</i> is the port number you specified
when you enabled the JMX agent when you started the JVM.  For more information,
see <a href="agent.html#remote">Remote JMX Monitoring and Management</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not specify a host name/port number
combination, then jconsole will display a connection dialog box
(see the next section) enabling you to enter a host name and port number.</p>

<h3>Connecting to a JMX Agent</h3>

<p>If you start <code>jconsole</code> with arguments specifying a JMX agent to which to connect, it
will automatically start monitoring the specified JVM.  You can connect to a different host at any time by choosing
<b>Connection | New Connection</b>. and entering the necessary
information.</p>
<p>Otherwise,
if you do not provide any arguments when you start <code>jconsole</code>, the first thing you see is the
connection dialog box.&nbsp; This dialog box has three tabs:</p>
<p>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local</li>
  <li>Remote</li>
  <li>Advanced</li>
</ul>

<h4>Local Tab</h4>

<p><img src="images/connect.jpg" title="" alt="Connection dialog" width="234" height="217">
</p>

<p>The local tab lists any JVMs running on the local system started with the same user ID as jconsole, along with
their process ID and class/argument information.&nbsp; Select the
application you want to monitor, then click Connect.
</p>

<h4>Remote Tab</h4>

<p><img src="images/connectrem.jpg" title="" alt="Connection dialog remote tab" width="234" height="217">
</p>

<p>To monitor a remote JVM, enter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Host name: name of the machine on which the JVM is
running.</li>
<li>Port number: the JMX agent port number you specified when you
started the JVM.</li>

<li>User name and password: the user name and password to use (required
only if monitoring a&nbsp; JVM through a JMX agent that requires
password authentication).
</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on setting the port number of the JMX agent, see
<a href="agent.html#jmxagent">Enabling the JMX Management
Agent</a>.  For information on user names and passwords, see
<a href="agent.html#PasswordAccessFiles">Using Password and Access
Files</a>.
</p>
<p>To monitor the JVM running jconsole, simply
click Connect, using host localhost and the port zero (0).</p>
<h4>Advanced Tab</h4>

<p><img src="images/connectadv.jpg" title="" alt="Connection dialog advanced tab" width="234" height="217">
</p>

<p>The advanced tab enables you to connect to other JMX agents (MBean
servers) by specifying their JMX URL, and the user name and
password.&nbsp; The syntax of a JMX URL is described in the API
documentation for <a href="../../api/javax/management/remote/JMXServiceURL.html">javax.management.remote.JMXServiceURL</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="interface" id="interface"></a>The jconsole
interface</h2>

<p>The jconsole interface is composed of six tabs:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2><a name="memory" id="memory"></a>Monitoring Memory
Consumption</h2>

<p>The Memory tab provides information on memory consumption and
memory pools.</p>

<p><img src="images/memtab.jpg" title="" alt="jconsole memory tab" width="646" height="512"></p>

<p>The chart shows the JVM's memory use versus time, for heap and
non-heap memory, and for specific memory pools.  The memory pools
available depend on the JVM being used.  For
the HotSpot JVM, the pools are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eden Space (heap): pool from which memory is initially
allocated for most objects.</li>
<li>Survivor Space (heap): pool containing objects that have
survived GC of eden space.</li>
<li>Tenured Generation (heap): pool containing objects that have
existed for some time in the survivor space.</li>
<li>Permanent Generation (non-heap): holds all the reflective data
of the virtual machine itself, such as class and method objects. With JVMs that use <a href="../vm/class-data-sharing.html">class data sharing</a>, this generation is divided into
read-only and read-write areas.</li>
<li>Code Cache (non-heap): HotSpot JVM also includes a "code cache"
containing memory used for compilation and storage of native
code.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on these memory pools,  see <a href="#gc">Garbage Collection.</a></p>

<p>The <b>Details</b> area shows several current memory
metrics:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Used</b>: the amount of memory currently used.  Memory
used includes the memory occupied by all objects including both
reachable and unreachable objects.</li>
<li><b>Committed</b>: the amount of memory guaranteed to be
available for use by the JVM. The amount of committed memory may
change over time. The Java virtual machine may release memory to
the system and committed could be less than the amount of memory initially allocated at startup. Committed will
always be greater than or equal to used.</li>
<li><b>Max</b>: the maximum amount of memory that can be used for
memory management. Its value may change or be undefined.  A memory
allocation may fail if the JVM attempts to increase the used memory
to be greater than committed memory, even if the amount used is
less than or equal to max (for example, when the system is low on
virtual memory).</li>
</ul>

<p>The bar chart at the lower right shows memory consumed by the
memory pools in heap and non-heap memory.&nbsp; The bar will turn red
when the memory used exceeds the memory usage threshold.&nbsp; You can
set the memory usage threshold through an attribute of the MemoryMXBean.
</p>

<h3>Heap and Non-heap Memory</h3>

<p>The JVM manages two kinds of memory:  heap and non-heap memory,
both created when it starts.</p>

<p><i>Heap memory</i> is the runtime data area from which the JVM
allocates memory for all class instances and arrays.  The heap may
be of a fixed or variable size.  The <i>garbage collector</i> is an
automatic memory management system that reclaims heap memory for
objects.</p>

<p><i>Non-heap memory</i> includes a method area shared among all
threads and memory required for the internal processing or
optimization for the JVM. It stores per-class structures such as a
runtime constant pool, field and method data, and the code for
methods and constructors.  The method area is logically part of the
heap but, depending on implementation, a JVM may not garbage
collect or compact it. Like the heap, the method area may be of
fixed or variable size. The memory for the method area does not
need to be contiguous.</p>

<p>In addition to the method area, a JVM implementation may require
memory for internal processing or optimization which also belongs
to non-heap memory. For example, the JIT compiler requires memory
for storing the native machine code translated from the JVM code
for high performance.</p>

<h3>Memory Pools and Memory Managers</h3>

<p>Memory pools and memory managers are key aspects of the JVM
memory system.</p>

<p>A <i>memory pool</i> represents a memory area that the JVM
manages. The JVM has at least one memory pool and it may create or
remove memory pools during execution. A memory pool can belong to
either heap or non-heap memory.</p>

<p>A <i>memory manager</i> manages one or more memory pools. The
garbage collector is a type of memory manager responsible for
reclaiming memory used by unreachable objects. A JVM may have one
or more memory managers. It may add or remove memory managers
during execution. A memory pool can be managed by more than one
memory manager.</p>

<h3><a name="gc" id="gc"></a>Garbage Collection</h3>

<p>Garbage collection (GC) is how the JVM frees memory occupied by
objects that are no longer referenced.  It is common to think of
objects that have active references as being "alive" and
un-referenced (or unreachable) objects as "dead."  Garbage
collection is the process of releasing memory used by the dead
objects.  The algorithms and parameters used by GC can have
dramatic effects on performance.</p>

<p>The HotSpot VM garbage collector uses <i>generational garbage
collection</i>. Generational GC takes advantage of the observation
that, in practice, most programs create:</p>

<ul>

<li>many objects that have short lives (for example, iterators and
local variables).</li>
<li>some objects that have very long lifetimes (for example, high
level persistent objects)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, generational GC divides memory into several
<i>generations</i>, and assigns each a memory pool. When a
generation uses up its allotted memory, the VM performs a partial
garbage collection (also called a <i>minor collection</i>) on that
memory pool to reclaim memory used by dead objects. This partial GC
is usually much faster than a full GC.</p>

<p>The HotSpot VM defines two generations: the <b>young
generation</b> (sometimes called the "nursery") and the <b>old
generation</b>. The young generation consists of an "eden space"
and two "survivor spaces."  The VM initially assigns all objects to
the eden space, and most objects die there.  When it performs a
minor GC, the VM moves any remaining objects from the eden space to
one of the survivor spaces.  The VM moves objects that live long
enough in the survivor spaces to the "tenured" space in the old
generation.  When the tenured generation fills up, there is a full
GC that is often much slower because it involves all live objects. 
The permanent generation  holds all the reflective data of the
virtual machine itself, such as class and method objects.</p>

<p>The default arrangement of generations looks something like
this:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/generations.gif" name="Graphic4" alt="space usage by generations" border="0" title="" width="400" height="222" id="Graphic4">
</p>

<p>As explained in the following documents, if the garbage
collector has become a bottleneck, you can improve performance by
customizing the generation sizes. Using jconsole, explore the
sensitivity of your performance metric to the garbage collector
parameters.  For more information, see:</p>

<h2><a name="thread" id="thread"></a>Monitoring Thread Use</h2>

<p>The Threads tab provides information on thread use.</p>

<p><img src="images/threadtab.jpg" title="" alt="jconsole thread tab" width="646" height="512"></p>

<p>The Threads list in the lower left lists all the active threads.
 If you enter a string in the Filter field, the Threads list will
show only those threads whose name contains the string you enter. 
Click on the name of a thread in the Threads list to display
information about that thread to the right, including the thread
name, state, and stack trace.</p>

<p>The chart shows the number of live threads versus time.  Three
lines are shown:</p>

<ul>
<li>Magenta: total number of threads</li>
<li>Red: peak number of threads</li>
<li>Blue: number of live threads.</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="../../api/index.html">java.lang.Thread</a> for more
information about threads and daemon threads.</p>

<h2><a name="class_loading" id="class_loading"></a>Monitoring Class
Loading</h2>

<p>The Classes tab displays information on class loading. </p>

<p><img src="images/classtab.jpg" title="" alt="jconsole class tab" width="646" height="512"></p>

<p>The graph plots the number of classes loaded versus
time:</p>

<ul>

<li>Red line is the total number of classes loaded (including those
subsequently unloaded).</li>
<li>Blue line is the current number of classes loaded. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Details section at the bottom of the tab displays the total
number of classes loaded since the JVM started, the number
currently loaded and the number unloaded.</p>

<h2><a name="MBeans" id="MBeans"></a>Monitoring and Managing
MBeans</h2>

<p>The MBean tab displays information on all the MBeans registered
with the platform MBean server.</p>

<p><img src="images/mbeantab.jpg" title="" alt="jconsole mbean tab" width="646" height="512"></p>

<p>The tree on the left shows all the MBeans, organized
according to their objectNames.  When you select an MBean in the
tree, its attributes, operations, notifications and other
information is displayed on the right.
</p>
<p>You can set the value of attributes, if they are writeable (the
value will be displayed in blue).&nbsp; You can also invoke operations
displayed in the Operations tab.
</p>
<h3>Displaying a Chart</h3>
<p>You can display a chart of an attribute's value versus time by
double-clicking on the attribute value.&nbsp; For example, if you click
on the value of the CollectionTime property of
java.lang.GarbageCollector.Copy MBean, you will see a chart that looks
something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/chart.jpg" title="" alt="chart vs. time" width="357" height="250">
</p>

<h2><a name="VM" id="VM"></a>Viewing VM Information</h2>

<p>The VM tab provides information on the JVM.</p>

<p><img src="images/vmtab.jpg" title="" alt="VM tab" width="640" height="504"></p>

<p>The information includes:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Uptime</b>: Total amount of time since the JVM was
started.</li>
<li><b>Process CPU Time</b>: Total amount of CPU time that the JVM
has consumed since it was started.</li>
<li><b>Total Compile Time</b>: Total accumulated time spent in
just-in-time (JIT) compilation. The JVM implementation determines
when JIT compilation occurs.  The Hotspot VM uses <i>adaptive
compilation</i>, in which the VM launches an application using a
standard interpreter, but then analyzes the code as it runs to
detect performance bottlenecks, or "hot spots".
</li>
</ul>
