<h2><a name="mbean_server" id="mbean_server"></a>Using the Platform
MBean Server</h2>

<p>An MBean server is a repository of MBeans that provides
management applications access to MBeans. Applications do not
access MBeans directly, but instead access them through the MBean
server with their unique <code>ObjectName</code>. An MBean server
implements the interface <a href="../../api/javax/management/MBeanServer.html" title="interface in javax.management"><code>javax.management.MBeanServer</code></a>.
</p>

<p>J2SE 5.0 introduces the <em>platform MBean server</em>, an MBean
server built-in to the JVM, which can be shared by all managed
components running in the JVM. You access the platform MBean server
with the method <a href="../../api/java/lang/management/ManagementFactory.html#getPlatformMBeanServer()">
<code>ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer()</code></a>.&nbsp;
Of course, you can also create your own MBean server using the
<a href="../../api/javax/management/MBeanServerFactory.html" title="class in javax.management"><code>MBeanServerFactory</code></a>
class.&nbsp; However, there is
generally no need for more than one MBean server, so using the platform MBean server is recommended.<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="access_mxbeans" id="access_mxbeans">Accessing Platform
MBeans</a></h2>

<p><a href="overview.html#mxbeans">Platform MBeans</a> (MXBeans)
were introduced previously.&nbsp; A management application can
access platform MBeans three different ways:</p>

<ul>

<li>Directly
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#method1">Using ManagementFactory</a></li>
    <li><a href="#method3">Using an MXBean proxy</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Indirectly, <a href="#method2">using MBeanServerConnection</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="method1" id="method1"></a>Using ManagementFactory</h3>

<p>An application can directly call the methods of a platform
MBean running in the same Java virtual machine.&nbsp; To do so, use
the static methods of the <a href="../../api/java/lang/management/ManagementFactory.html"><code>ManagementFactory</code></a>
class.&nbsp; <code>ManagementFactory</code>&nbsp; has accessor
methods for each platform MBean such as
<code>getClassLoadingMXBean()</code>,
<code>getGarbageCollectorMXBeans()</code>,
<code>getRuntimeMXBean()</code>, and so on.&nbsp; In the cases
where there are more than one platform MBean, the method returns a
<code>List</code> of platform MBeans.</p>

<p>For example, the following code uses the static method of
<code>ManagementFactory</code> to get the platform MBean
<code>RuntimeMXBean</code>, and then gets the vendor name from the
platform MBean:</p>

<pre>RuntimeMXBean mxbean = ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean();<br>String vendor = mxbean.getVmVendor(); <br></pre>

<h3><a name="method3" id="method3"></a>Using an MXBean Proxy</h3>

<p>An application can also call platform MBean methods through an
MXBean proxy.  To do so, construct an MXBean proxy instance that
forwards the method calls to a given MBeanServer by calling the
static method <a href="../../api/java/lang/management/ManagementFactory.html#newPlatformMXBeanProxy(javax.management.MBeanServerConnection, java.lang.String, java.lang.Class)">
<code>ManagementFactory.newPlatformMXBeanProxy()</code></a>. An
application typically constructs a proxy to remotely access a
platform MBean of another JVM.</p>

<p>For example, the following code does the same thing as the
previous example, but using an MXBean proxy:</p>

<pre>MBeanServerConnection mbs;<br>...<br>// Get a MBean proxy for RuntimeMXBean interface<br>RuntimeMXBean proxy =<br>    ManagementFactory.newPlatformMXBeanProxy(mbs,<br>                                             ManagementFactory.RUNTIME_MXBEAN_NAME,<br>                                             RuntimeMXBean.class);<br>// Get standard attribute "VmVendor"<br>String vendor = proxy.getVmVendor();<br></pre>

<h3><a name="method2" id="method2"></a>Using
MBeanServerConnection</h3>

<p>An application can indirectly call platform MBean methods
through an <code>MBeanServerConnection</code> connecting to the
platform MBeanServer of a running JVM.  You use the
<code>getAttribute()</code> method of
<code>MBeanServerConnection</code> to get an attribute of a
platform MBean, providing the MBean's <code>ObjectName</code> and
the attribute name as parameters.</p>

<p>For example, the following code does the same thing as the
previous two examples, but uses an indirect call through
<code>MBeanServerConnection</code>:</p>

<pre>MBeanServerConnection mbs;<br>...<br>try {<br>  ObjectName oname = new ObjectName(ManagementFactory.RUNTIME_MXBEAN_NAME);<br>  // Get standard attribute "VmVendor"<br>  String vendor = (String) mbs.getAttribute(oname, "VmVendor");<br>} catch (....) {<br>  // Catch the exceptions thrown by ObjectName constructor<br>  // and MBeanServer.getAttribute method<br>  ...<br>}<br></pre>
<h2><a name="extension" id="extension">Using Sun's Platform Extension</a></h2>





<p>JVM implementations may extend the management interface by
defining interfaces for platform-specific metrics and management
operations. The static factory methods in the
<tt>ManagementFactory</tt> class will return the MBeans with the
platform extension.  <br>
</p>
<p>The <code>com.sun.management</code> package
contains Sun Microsystems' platform extensions.&nbsp; The following examples show how to access a platform-specific
attribute from Sun's implementation of the
<tt>RuntimeMXBean</tt>.</p>


<h3>Direct Access<br>
</h3>


<p>This example illustrates direct access to the Sun-specific
MXBean interface:</p>

<pre>com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean mxbean =<br>  (com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean) ManagementFactory.getOperatingSystemMXBean();<br><br>// Get the number of processors<br>int numProcessors = mxbean.getAvailableProcessors();<br><br>// Get the Sun-specific attribute Process CPU time<br>long cpuTime = mxbean.getProcessCpuTime();<br></pre>

<h3>Access Through MBeanServerConnection</h3>


<p>This example illustrates access to the Sun-specific MXBean
interface via <tt>MBeanServerConnection:</tt></p>

<pre>MBeanServerConnection mbs;<br><br>// Connect to a running JVM (or itself) and get MBeanServerConnection<br>// that has the JVM MXBeans registered in it<br>...<br><br>try {<br>    // Assuming the OperatingSystem MXBean has been registered in mbs<br>    ObjectName oname = new ObjectName(ManagementFactory.OPERATING_SYSTEM_MXBEAN_NAME);<br><br>    // Get standard attribute "OperatingSystem"<br>    String vendor = (String) mbs.getAttribute(oname, "OperatingSystem");<br><br>    // Check if this MXBean contains Sun's extension<br>    if (mbs.isInstanceOf(oname, "com.sun.management.RuntimeMXBean")) {<br>        // Get platform-specific attribute "ProcessCpuTime"<br>        BarType bar = (String) mbs.getAttribute(oname, "ProcessCpuTime");<br>    }<br>} catch (....) {<br>    // Catch the exceptions thrown by ObjectName constructor<br>    // and MBeanServer methods<br>    ...<br>}<br></pre>


<h2><a name="thread_cm" id="thread_cm"></a>Monitoring Thread Contention and CPU Time<br>
</h2>

<p>The <a href="../../api/java/lang/management/ThreadMXBean.html"><code>ThreadMXBean</code></a> platform MBean provides support for monitoring thread contention and thread CPU time.<code><br>
</code></p>
<p>The Sun HotSpot JVM supports thread
contention monitoring. Use the 
<code>ThreadMXBean.isThreadContentionMonitoringSupported()</code>
method to determine if a JVM supports thread contention monitoring.
Thread contention monitoring is disabled by default. Use the
<code>setThreadContentionMonitoringEnabled()</code> method to
enable it.<br>
</p>
<p>The Sun HotSpot JVM supports measuring
 thread CPU time on most platforms.  The CPU time provided by this interface has nanosecond precision
 but not necessarily nanosecond accuracy.<br>
</p>
<p>Use the <code>isThreadCpuTimeSupported()</code> to determine
 if a JVM supports measuring of the CPU time for any 
 thread and <code>isCurrentThreadCpuTimeSupported()</code> to determine if a JVM supports measuring of 
 the CPU time for the current  thread.
 A Java virtual machine implementation that supports CPU time measurement 
 for any thread will also support that for the current thread.

 </p>
<p>

 </p>
<p>
 A JVM may disable thread CPU time measurement.
 Use the <code>isThreadCpuTimeEnabled()</code> method to determine if thread CPU time measurement is enabled
. Use the <code>setThreadCpuTimeEnabled()</code>
 method to enable/disable this thread CPU time measurement.&nbsp;

 </p>


<h2><a name="low_memory" id="memory"></a>Detecting Low Memory</h2>

<p>Memory use is an important attribute of the memory system. It
can indicate:</p>

<ul>

<li>Memory consumption of an application</li>
<li>Workload being imposed on the automatic memory management
system</li>
<li>Potential memory leakage.</li>
</ul>

<p>As described below, there are two kinds of memory thresholds you can
use to detect low memory conditions: a usage threshold and a collection
usage threshold.&nbsp; You can detect low
memory conditions using either of these thresholds with
<a href="#Polling">polling</a> or <a href="#ThresholdNotification">threshold notification</a>.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Memory monitoring is intended for load-balancing or
workload distribution: for example, an application could stop
receiving new workload when its memory usage exceeds a certain
threshold. Memory monitoring is not intended to enable an
application to detect and recover from a low memory
condition.</p>

<p>For more information, see the API reference for <a href="../../api/java/lang/management/MemoryPoolMXBean.html">MemoryPoolMXBean</a>.
</p>

<h3>Memory Thresholds</h3>

<p>A memory pool may have two kinds of memory thresholds: a <a href="#UsageThreshold">usage
threshold</a> and a <a href="#CollectionThreshold">collection usage threshold</a>. Either one of these thresholds may not be supported by a particular memory pool.</p>

<h4><a name="UsageThreshold" id="UsageThreshold">Usage
Threshold</a></h4>

<p>The <i>usage
threshold</i> is a manageable attribute of some memory pools.&nbsp; It enables monitoring
memory use with low overhead.  Setting the threshold to a positive
value enables usage threshold checking for a memory pool. Setting
the usage threshold to zero disables usage threshold checking. The default value is supplied
by the JVM.
</p>

<p>A JVM performs usage threshold checking on a memory pool at the
most appropriate time, typically during GC. Each memory pool
increments a usage threshold count whenever the usage crosses the
threshold.</p>

<p>Use the <code>isUsageThresholdSupported()</code>method to
determine whether a memory pool supports a usage threshold, since a
usage threshold is not appropriate for some memory pools. For
example, in a generational garbage collector (such as the HotSpot
VM), most of the objects are allocated in the young generation,
from the "eden" memory pool. The eden pool is designed to be filled
up; garbage collecting the eden memory pool will free most of its memory space
since it is expected to contain mostly short-lived objects
unreachable at garbage collection time. So, it is not appropriate
for the eden memory pool to support a usage threshold.</p>

<h4><a name="CollectionThreshold" id="CollectionThreshold">Collection Usage Threshold</a></h4>

<p><i>Collection usage threshold</i> is a manageable attribute of
some garbage-collected memory pools.  After a JVM has performed
garbage collection on a memory pool, some memory in the pool will
still be in use. The collection usage threshold allows you to set a
value for this memory.  Use the <code>isCollectionUsageThresholdSupported()</code> method 
of MemoryPoolMXBean to determine if the pool supports a collection
usage threshold.<br>
</p>

<p>A JVM may check the collection usage threshold on a memory pool
when it performs GC. Set the collection usage threshold to a
positive value to enable checking. Set the collection usage
threshold to zero (the default) to disable checking.</p>

<h3><a name="Polling" id="Polling">Using Polling<br>
</a></h3>

<p>An application can continuously monitor its memory usage by
calling either the <code>getUsage()</code> method for all memory
pools or the <code>isUsageThresholdExceeded()</code> method for
memory pools that support a usage threshold.</p>

<p>The following example has a thread dedicated to task
distribution and processing. At every interval, it determines if it
should receive and process new tasks based on its memory usage. If
the memory usage exceeds its usage threshold, it redistributes
outstanding tasks to other VMs and stops receiving new tasks until
the memory usage returns below the threshold.</p>

<pre>pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);<br>....<br>boolean lowMemory = false;<br>while (true) {<br>  if (pool.isUsageThresholdExceeded()) {<br>    lowMemory = true;<br>    redistributeTasks();  // redistribute tasks to other VMs<br>    stopReceivingTasks();  // stop receiving new tasks<br>  } else {<br>    if (lowMemory) { // resume receiving tasks<br>      lowMemory = false;<br>      resumeReceivingTasks();<br>    }<br>    // processing outstanding task<br>    ...<br>  }<br>  // sleep for sometime<br>  try {<br>    Thread.sleep(sometime);<br>  } catch (InterruptedException e) {<br>    ...<br>  }<br>}         <br></pre>

<p>The above example does not differentiate the case where the
memory usage has temporarily dropped below the usage threshold from
the case where the memory usage remains above the threshold
between two iterations. You can use the usage threshold count
returned by <code>getUsageThresholdCount()</code>to determine if
the memory usage has returned below the threshold between two
polls.<br>
</p>
<p>To test collection usage threshold instead, you would use the <code>isCollectionUsageThresholdSupported()</code>, <code>isCollectionThresholdExceeded()</code> and <code>getCollectionUsageThreshold()</code> methods similarly.</p>


<h3><a name="ThresholdNotification" id="ThresholdNotification">Using Threshold Notifications</a></h3>

<p>When the&nbsp; the <code>MemoryMXBean</code> detects that a memory pool has reached or exceeded
its usage threshold, it emits a <i>usage threshold exceeded</i> notification. The
<code>MemoryMXBean</code> will not issue another usage threshold
exceeded notification until the usage has fallen below the
threshold and then exceeded it again.&nbsp; Similarly, when the memory
usage after garbage collection exceeds the collection usage threshold,
the <code>MemoryMXBean</code> emits a <i>collection usage threshold exceeded</i> notification.<br>
</p>

<p>The example code below implements the same logic as in the
polling example, but uses usage threshold notification to detect
low memory conditions. Upon receiving notification, the listener
notifies another thread to perform actions such as to redistribute
outstanding tasks, stop receiving tasks, or resume receiving
tasks.</p>

<p>In general, design the <tt>handleNotification</tt> method to do
a minimal amount of work, to avoid causing delay in delivering
subsequent notifications. Perform time-consuming actions in a
separate thread. Since multiple threads can concurrently invoke the
notification listener, the listener should properly synchronize the
tasks it performs.</p>

<pre>class MyListener implements javax.management.NotificationListener {<br>  public void handleNotification(Notification notification, Object handback)  {<br>    String notifType = notification.getType();<br>    if (notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED)) {<br>      // potential low memory, redistribute tasks to other VMs &amp; stop receiving new tasks.<br>      lowMemory = true;<br>      notifyAnotherThread(lowMemory);<br>    }<br>  }<br>}<br><br>// Register MyListener with MemoryMXBean<br>MemoryMXBean mbean = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();<br>NotificationEmitter emitter = (NotificationEmitter) mbean;<br>MyListener listener = new MyListener();<br>emitter.addNotificationListener(listener, null, null);<br></pre>

<p>Assuming this memory pool supports a usage threshold, you can
then set the threshold to some value (representing a number of
bytes), above which the app will not accept new tasks.</p>

<pre>pool.setUsageThreshold(myThreshold);<br></pre>

<p>After this point, usage threshold detection is enabled and
MyListener will handle notification.<br>
</p>
