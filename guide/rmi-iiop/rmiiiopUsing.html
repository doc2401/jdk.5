<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>When should I use RMI-IIOP?</H1>



<P>RMI-IIOP is for developers who program in the  
Java programming language and want to program to the RMI interfaces, but use IIOP as the 
underlying transport.  RMI-IIOP provides interoperability with other CORBA 
objects implemented in various languages - but only if all the remote interfaces 
are originally defined as Java RMI interfaces.  It is of particular interest to 
programmers using Enterprise JavaBeans<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> (EJB<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>), since the remote object model for 
EJB components is based on the RMI API.

<P>RMI-IIOP combines the best features of Java Remote 
Method Invocation (RMI) with the best features of CORBA.   RMI-IIOP speeds distributed 
application development by 
allowing developers to work completely in the Java programming 
language, writing remote 
interfaces in the Java programming language and implementing them simply 
using Java technology and the Java RMI APIs.  

<P>When using RMI-IIOP to
produce technology-based distributed applications written in the Java programming language, there is no
separate Interface Definition Language (IDL) or mapping to learn: the remote interfaces can 
be implemented in any other language that is supported by an OMG mapping and a vendor 
supplied ORB 
for that language. Similarly, clients can be written in other languages 
using IDL derived from the remote Java technology-based interfaces.   

<P>RMI-IIOP provides flexibility by allowing developers to 
pass any Java object between application 
components either by reference  or by value.

<P>Like CORBA,  RMI-IIOP is based on open 
standards defined with the participation of hundreds of vendors and 
users in the Object Management Group.  Like CORBA, RMI-IIOP uses Internet Inter-ORB Protocol 
(IIOP) as its communication protocol.  IIOP eases legacy application and platform 
integration by allowing application components written in C++, Smalltalk, and other CORBA 
supported languages to communicate with components  running on the Java platform.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>What other options do I have for distributed application development?</H1>

<P>Developers who program using the Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>  programming language can choose several 
solutions for creating distributed applications programs.  

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> <STRONG>RMI</STRONG>  technology -  If all of your 
applications are written in the Java programming language, you will probably want
        to use <a href="../rmi/index.html">Java RMI technology</a>  to enable communication between Java 
objects on different virtual machines and different
        physical machines. Using Java RMI technology without its IIOP option leverages its strengths of 
code portability,
        security, and garbage collection. 
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> IDL </STRONG>  technology - <a 
target="AuxWindow" href="../idl/index.html">Java IDL technology</a> are for CORBA programmers who want to program in the 
Java programming 
language based on interfaces defined in CORBA Interface Definition Language 
(IDL).  This is "business as usual" CORBA programming, supporting the 
Java platform in exactly 
the same way as other languages like C++ or COBOL.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Enterprise JavaBeans<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>  technology</STRONG> - <a 
target="AuxWindow" href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/index.jsp">Enterprise JavaBeans<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP></a> (EJB<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>) technology is part of the 
Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition.   EJB components use the Java RMI/Java IDL technology for their 
distributed object model, and use the Java Transaction Service (JTS) for their distributed 
transaction model.  When Enterprise JavaBeans components are implemented using the RMI-IIOP protocol 
for EJB component interoperability in heterogeneous server environments, the standard mapping of the 
EJB architecture to CORBA enables interoperability with multivendor ORBs, other EJB servers, 
and  CORBA clients written in programming languages other than the Java programming language.  For an
example application that uses an EJB server with a CORBA client, look at <a target="AuxWindow" href="interop.html">
