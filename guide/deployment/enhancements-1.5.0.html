<h1>General Deployment Enhancements in J2SE 5.0</h1>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>Much of the common functionality between Java Plug-in and Java Web Start 
    has been combined. There is now a single Java Control Panel for both. It replaces 
    both the Java Plug-in Control Panel and the Preference panel of the Java Web 
    Start Application Manager. The settings are used in both products.

<p>
  <li>Security: (1) This release features improved security access and control, 
    including both user- and system-level security options and an expanded list 
    of deployment properties. (4667645) (2) Several new configuration properties 
    have been added so that an enterprise can customize user security settings. 
    These allow control of what applications a user is allowed to grant trust 
    to, and what permissions are given to code for which trust is granted. Also, 
    a user or enterprise can configure what information is to be displayed on 
    security warnings; and an enterprise can configure if a user is allowed to 
    run applications in the enhanced sandbox of the JNLP API. An enterprise can 
    also pre-accept its own certificates so that users will not see any security 
    warnings in its own applications.</li>
<p>
  <li>Enterprise Configuration: Both deployment products can now be configured 
    with an enterprise configuration file. This file, accessed as a URL, can set 
    any set of configuration properties, either as defaults, or as locked properties 
    which cannot be overridden by the user.</li>
<p>
  <li>Support is available for pack/crunch compression for downloading Java applications 
    and applets. Pack200, a new hyper-compression format for JAR files defined 
    by JSR-200, can reduce the download size of JNLP applications and Java Plug-in 
    applets. File size can be reduced to about 1/8th of the original size. (4666040)</li>
<p>
  <li>Support of browser keystores in Internet Explorer and Mozilla 
    in Java Plug-in and Web Start: 
    Certificates and keys in browser keystores will be used for
    signing verification, HTTPS server authentication, and HTTPS client
    authentication. Certificates and keys on the smart card exposed in 
    the browser keystore will also be recognized.  See 
    <a href="deployment-guide/keystores.html">Browser Keystores</a> for 
    more information.
    (4480333, 4957907)</li>
<p>
  <li>Support of time-stamped, signed JAR files: With time-stamping now
    built into the signing tool, Java Plug-in and Java Web Start now
    recognize the time-of-signing information when they verify a signed JAR
    file. This solves the problem of a signed applet signed with a valid
    certificate at time-of-signing but the certificate expired later after
    the applet deployment.

<p>
  <li>Support of Client Authentication in HTTPS: This release provides
    interactive user interface in Java Plug-in and Java Web Start during
    HTTPS client authentication for users to select the personal certificate
    from the personal keystore. (4802844)</li>
