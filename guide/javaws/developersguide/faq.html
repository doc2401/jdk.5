<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<P><A NAME="101"></A><B>What is Java Web Start?</B> 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start provides a platform-independent, secure, and robust
deployment technology. It enables developers to deploy full-featured
applications to end-users by making the applications available on a
standard web server. With any web browser, end-users can launch the
applications and be confident they always have the most-recent
version. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="102"></A><B>Where do I get more information?</B> 
</P>
<P>Look at the online documentation for <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws">Java
Web Start</A> .</P>
<P>If you are a developer, go to the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Developer's
Guide</A> for detailed technical information on how to deploy
applications using Java Web Start. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back
to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="103"></A><B>Why should I use Java Web Start?</B> 
</P>
<P>It's an easy, robust, and secure way to deploy applications
directly from the web. Developers can make applications readily
available via the web. In addition, Java Web Start provides Java
runtime environment (JRE) management capabilities, it's easy to set
up, it's browser-independent, and it's an efficient way to deploy web
application solutions. 
</P>
<P>Users can easily access applications much as they would a web
page--without a separate installation step. From the desktop, users
can access and use Java applications, using a
richer and more responsive user interface than is available on a web
page. And, once a Java Web Start based application is installed,
users simply click to run the application whenever needed. 
</P>
<P>Users do not need to manually update applications because each
time they launch an application, it is transparently updated from the
web--so they always use the most recent version available. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back
to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="104"></A><B>How can I launch applications with Java Web
Start?</B> 
</P>
<P>You initially launch a new application by clicking on a link from
a web page.</P>
<P>If you use an application frequently, create a shortcut from your
desktop or from the Start Menu by allowing Java Web Start to place an
icon on your desktop. Java Web Start may ask if you would like to
create <BR>shortcuts or an entry in the Start Menu. If you say &quot;yes,&quot;
all future launches of the application can start without a browser. 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start also provides an Application Cache Viewer which you
can launch from the Java Control Panel.&nbsp; The Cache Viewer
enables you to directly launch applications you have downloaded. 
</P>
<P>You can also launch an application from a command prompt by typing
&ldquo;javaws &lt;jnlp_url&gt;&rdquo; where &lt;jnlp_url is a url to
the jnlp file of the application.<BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back
to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="105"></A><B>Does it matter how I launch an application?</B>
</P>
<P>No, applications launch in the same manner no matter which method
you use: from a web page, from the shortcut on the desktop, from the
Start menu, or through the Java Application Cache Viewer. 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start always checks to see if a newer version of the
application is available for use and automatically downloads it if
so. 
</P>
<P>If the application you are using has not been digitally signed,
Java Web Start will launch it in a restricted and secure execution
environment. An application that is not signed, or one that you do
not trust, will never be run with unrestricted access to your local
system or network. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="106"></A><B>What are the system requirements for Java Web
Start?</B> 
</P>
<P>Any client system that supports the Java version 1.2.2 or higher can use Java
Web Start. Java Web Start works with virtually all browsers. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back
to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="107"></A><B>What platforms does Java Web Start run on?</B>
</P>
<P>Sun Microsystems provides versions for Windows 98/NT/2000/XP/2003,
Solaris Operating Environment (SPARC and Intel editions) and
Linux/i486. <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/java">Apple</A>
provides a version for their OS X release. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back
to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="108"></A><B>What are the server requirements for Java Web
Start?</B> 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start uses HTTP for communication between the client and
the server. You can use a standard web server to host an application.
If you require additional services, such as version-based
downloading, incremental updates, or pack200 compression for your
applications, the web server will need to support servlets or Java Server
Pages. A sample servlet implementing these features is provided
in the samples directory of the JDK.<BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back
to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="109"></A><B>Is Java Web Start based on a standard?</B> 
</P>
<P>Yes. Java Web Start 1.5.0 is the product-quality reference
implementation of Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) technology,
which was developed through the Java Community Process.&nbsp; JNLP is
specification number JSR 056.&nbsp; Other platform vendors are
encouraged to port Java Web Start to their platform or implement the
specification. 
</P>
<P>For more information, see the <A HREF="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=56">JNLP
specification</A>.&nbsp; <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="110"></A><B>Can I implement my own Java Web Start?</B> 
</P>
<P>The underlying technology for Java Web Start, the Java Network
Launching Protocol and API is being developed through the Java
Community Process, so you can implement this protocol in any product.
However additional licensing and terms must be met to implement any
JCP technology including the JNLP technology. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back
to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="111"></A><B>What are the supported browsers?</B> 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start supports primarily Internet Explorer 4 or higher
and Mozilla. However any browser can launch JNLP files if you
have set the MIME-type association correctly. Java Web Start uses the
browser's settings and may launch a browser to show a URL; this
feature may not work with unsupported browsers. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back

<P><A NAME="113"></A><B>Can I deploy any application with Java Web
Start?</B> 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start is an application launcher for Java 
applications that are written to be web-deployed. 
</P>
<P>An application must be delivered in a set of JAR files and all
application resources, such as images, configuration files, and
native libraries must be included in the JAR files. The resources
must be looked up using the method <TT>ClassLoader.getResource()</TT>
or an equivalent method. Java Web Start only transfers JAR files from
the web server to the client. 
</P>
<P>If an application is written to run in a restricted execution
environment (sandbox), then access to disk is not permitted and the
application may only connect to the host on which it resides. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back
to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><B>Is Java Web Start a software distribution mechanism like
Marimba and MS SMS?</B> 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start is an application launcher for Java 
applications. It allows easy distribution of
full-featured applications based on the Java platform from a web
server to a client machine with minimal user interaction. 
</P>
<P>The software distribution technology is only one aspect of Java
Web Start. It also provides security, updates to the applications,
ease-of-use for end users, and flexibility for developers when they
create the applications. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="115"></A><A NAME="114"></A><B>Is Java Web Start an
application installer?</B> 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start is an application launcher for Java 
applications that are written to be web-deployed.
Java Web Start caches resources locally on the disk, but also
provides a secure execution environment and a virtually transparent
updating facility for applications. The end user does not need to
manually initiate a software update because the application is
updated each time it is used. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to
top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="116"></A><B>What version of the Java platform does Java
Web Start work with?</B> 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start launches only applications written for the Java 
platform versions 1.2.2 and higher. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="117"></A><B>How does Java Web Start relate to Java
Plug-in Technology (applets)?</B> 
</P>
<P>The two approaches are very similar. The key difference is in the
user experience. If the Java application/applet needs to interact
with a web page and be tightly bound to a web browser, then applets
may be the solution. On the other hand, if browser independence is
important, then Java Web Start is the deployment platform of choice.
There are a number of other differences, but this is the fundamental
difference. 
</P>
<P>Java Plug-in technology enables users to run Java 
applets inside a browser. 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start enables users to download full-featured
applications with any browser. Once they have downloaded and launched
an application, the browser can be closed, while the application
continues working. The application does not depend on an open browser
to function. The browser can be shut down or you can go to a
different web page and the application will continue running. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back

<H2>Technical Questions</H2>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<P><A NAME="201"></A><B>Do I need to change my application to work
with Java Web Start?</B> 
</P>
<P>If your application is written to the Java 2 platform, and is
delivered as a set of JAR files, there should be no need to revise
your application.&nbsp; Make sure that your application retrieves all
its resources (such as images and resource bundles) from a JAR file,
since Java Web Start launches an application by invoking the <TT>public
static void main(String[] args)</TT> method. 
</P>
<P>If your application needs unrestricted access to the system, (for
example, network or disk access), you will need to sign your code.
<BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="202"></A><B>Is there a migration path from applets to
applications?</B>&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start is primarily designed for application deployment.
You specify all requirements for your application in the JNLP file,
and off you go. It does provide the ability to launch applets in much
the same way as the traditional AppletViewer. The built-in
AppletViewer provides an easy migration path for existing applets
that want to take advantage of Java Web Start. However, it is not
intended to be a full implementation of the Plug-In. The Plug-In is
the primary launching vehicle for applets. The built-in AppletViewer
in Java Web Start has&nbsp; limitations, for example, you cannot
specify class files as resources and it does not accept policy files.
<BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="203"></A><B>Is there a way to pass VM arguments to the
Java Runtime?</B> 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start allows certain JVM flags to be set with the
<CODE>java-vm-args</CODE> attribute of the <TT>j2se </TT>element 
(see <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/syntax.html#resources">Developer's
Guide</A>).
Allowing the complete set could compromise security as well as limit
portability across different platforms and implementations. You can
set the maximum and initial heap size using the initial-heap-size and
max-heap-size attributes of the j2se element, for example: 
</P>
<P>&lt;j2se version=&quot;...&quot; max-heap-size=&quot;100M&quot;/&gt;</P>
<P><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="204"></A><B>I don't want to rely on a server timestamp.
How can I specify a versioned JAR and how can I get incremental
updates of JARs?</B> 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start supports versioned JARs and incremental updates.
You can specify exact versions of the JAR files you want, instead of
relying on timestamp information to determine if an update is
available. Using version IDs also allows you to provide incremental
updates from one version to another. See the <A HREF="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=56">JNLP
Specification</A> or the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Developer's
Guide</A> for details.<BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="205"></A><B>Are JAR files shared between applications?</B>
</P>
<P>Each JAR file that a JNLP Client (such as Java Web Start)
downloads, is uniquely identified with a URL. If two JNLP files use
the same URL, then the resource will only be downloaded once and
shared. This is similar to the caching implementations used by web
browsers. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="206"></A><B>How can I provide my own splash screen?</B> 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start needs to put up the initial splash screen while
Java is loading. For subsequent access, you can specify an image file
to use for the splash screen in the JNLP file with the tag</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&lt;icon href=&quot;mysplash.jpg&quot; kind=&quot;splash&quot;/&gt; </PRE><P>
where <CODE>mysplash.jpg</CODE> is the image file for your splash
screen.&nbsp; The first time your application runs, it will use the
standard splash screen. After that, it will use the image you
provide. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="207"></A><B>How can I save the application state on the
local system?</B> 
</P>
<P>A sandboxed application can store state using the
<TT>PersistenceService</TT> API. This API is similar to cookies for
HTML pages. Thus, it is a secure way to store persistent information
on the client computer.&nbsp; For more information, see:

the JRE. How do I specify this my JNLP file?</B> 
</P>
<P>The tag &lt;j2se version=&quot;versionNum&quot;&gt; specifies a
platform version, where versionNum is 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5.</P>
<P>You can request a specific product version by including a vendor
URL in the href attribute. For Sun's JREs, the URL is
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se">http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se</A>
 For example, the following J2SE tag will request any Sun 1.3.1
implementation:  
</P>
<PRE>&lt;j2se version=&quot;1.3.1*&quot; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se">http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se</A>&quot;/&gt;
 </PRE><P>
You can see all the versions of the installed JREs in the Java tab of
the Java Control Panel. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="209"></A><B>Can I rely on Class-Path in the manifest
file?</B> 
</P>
<P>Java Web Start does not support the Class-Path entry in the
manifest file. The Class-Path attribute is entirely file-centric,
whereas Java Web Start and JNLP is web-centric, i.e., based on URLs.
Thus, the two models do not merge easily. 
</P>
<P>Instead of relying on the Class-Path entry, you can list multiple
JAR files in the JNLP file, for example: 
</P>
<PRE>&lt;resources&gt;
 &lt;jar href=&quot;A.jar&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;jar href=&quot;B.jar&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;</PRE><P>
In a JNLP file, you can factor out dependencies on a set of JAR files
to another JNLP file using the <TT>&lt;extension... &gt;</TT>
element. Thus, you can achieve the same kind of re-usability and ease
of maintenance as you do with the Class-Path entry. This feature is
described in the specification. 
</P>
<P>JNLP also implements a just-in-time downloading mechanism, similar
to applets. For each resource in a JNLP file, you can specify which
parts should be eagerly or lazily downloaded.&nbsp; Eagerly loaded
resources are loaded before the application is launched, lazily
loaded resources later.&nbsp; Default is eager download. Furthermore,
the specification includes an API for which you can programatically
query Java Web Start about which resources are available and request
them to be downloaded. Thus, you can write download/network aware
applications.</P>

application depends on or uses native code?</B> 
</P>
<P>You can use Java Web Start to deploy Java Technology-based
applications that depend on native code such as DLLs and SOs. Use the
<TT>&lt;nativelib ...&gt;</TT> element to specify required native
libraries. See the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Developer's
Guide</A> for details.<BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="211"></A><B>How can I load resources within my
application using Class.forName and ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader?</B>
</P>
<P>Java Web Start uses a user-level classloader to load all the
application resources specified in the JNLP file. This classloader
implements the security model and the downloading model defined by
the JNLP specification. This is no different than how the
AppletViewer or the Java Plug-In works. 
</P>
<P>This has the, unfortunate, side-effect that <TT>Class.forName</TT>
will not find any resources that are defined in the JNLP file. The
same is true for looking up resources and classes using the system
class loader (<TT>ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader</TT>). 
</P>
<P>To find application resources in Java Web Start, use the
classloader that loaded your application, for example use the
following call in the in the application;s main thread: 
</P>
<P><TT>this.getClass().getClassLoader();</TT></P>
<P>You can also use:</P>
<P><TT>Thread.getCurrent().getContextClassLoader();</TT><BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back

</P>
<P><A NAME="212"></A><B>How can I launch Java Web Start from the
command line?</B> 
</P>
<P>You can launch Java Web Start from the command line as follows:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">javaws [options] <I>your-app-JNLP-URL</I></PRE><P>
where your-app-JNLP-URL is the location of your application's JNLP
file.&nbsp; For example: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">javaws http://java.sun.com/products/demos/swingset2.jnlp </PRE><P>

</P>
<P><A NAME="213"></A><B>How do I use multiple JAR files signed by
different certificates?</B> 
</P>
<P>The JNLP 1.0 specification requires all JAR files used in a JNLP
file to be signed by the same certificate. This restriction avoids
requiring the user to accept multiple certificates from the same
source, and enables Java Web Start to know if the user has accepted
all certificates used for an application. 
</P>
<P>However, Java Web Start can use multiple JAR files signed by
different certificates, by using the component extension mechanism
and multiple JNLP files.&nbsp; The only requirement is that the JAR
files contain code from different packages.&nbsp; So, instead of the
following: 
</P>
<PRE>&lt;jar href=&quot;myjar1.jar&quot;/&gt;
&lt;jar href=&quot;jh.jar&quot;/&gt; </PRE><P>
Use the following: 
</P>
<PRE>&lt;jar href=&quot;myjar1.jar&quot;/&gt;
&lt;extension name=&quot;Java Help&quot; href=&quot;help.jnlp&quot;/&gt; </PRE><P>
Then add a <TT>help.jnlp</TT> file with the following contents: 
</P>
<PRE>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;jnlp spec=&quot;1.0+&quot;

&lt;vendor&gt;Sun Microsystems, Inc.&lt;/vendor&gt;
 &lt;/information&gt;
&lt;resources&gt;
&lt;jar href=&quot;jh.jar&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
 &lt;component-desc/&gt;

<P><A NAME="214"></A><B>How do I detect if Java Web Start is
installed?</B> 
</P>
<P>You can write a short JavaScript or VBScript to detect if Java Web
Start is installed. See the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Developer's
Guide</A> for details.<BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="215"></A><B>Why does my browser shows JNLP file as plain
text ?</B></P>
<P>This is most likely happening because your web server is not aware
of the proper MIME type for JNLP files. Java Web Start requires only
one change to your web server, that is creating an association
between the file extension, typically jnlp, and the MIME type,
<TT>application/x-java-jnlp-file</TT>. The steps for doing this vary
depending upon the web server you are using. 
</P>
<P>Furthermore, if your corporation uses a proxy server, ensure that
the update versions of the files are returned, by updating the time
stamp of the resources on the web server such that the proxies will
update their caches. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="216"></A><B>Why does Java Web Start always reload JAR
files from IIS server?</B> 
</P>
<P>If a timestamp of the file on the IIS server is in the future IIS
returns current-time as last-modified time. This makes Java Web Start
to reload the JARs since time-stamp is always newer. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back

<P><A NAME="217"></A><B>Can I use Pack200 compression with the
JnlpDownloadServlet? </B>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Yes.  The JnlpDownloadServlet
distributed in the samples directory of the JDK now supports Pack200.
 If you deploy yourfile.jar along with </SPAN>yourfile.jar.pack.gz
the packed file will be downloaded when the client is running Java
Web Start 1.5.0 or later.<B><BR></B><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back

<P><A NAME="218"></A><B>What is the best way to ensure only one
instance of my application is run?</B></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Use the SingleInstanceService to
register as a singleton as soon as your application starts up.  Re-invoking
your application before it is registered as a singleton will cause
another Java VM to start up.  </SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Make sure to unregister before
your program exits.</SPAN><B><BR></B><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back

</P>
<P><A NAME="219"></A><B>When will properties set in the jnlp file get
set?</B></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Normally, properties in the jnlp
file will not be set until the first resource listed in that jnlp
file is loaded.  This insures the properties are set before any of
your code is run, however some properties need to be set before other
packages are loaded.  Some properties are considered to be &ldquo;secure&rdquo;
by Java Web Start, and, when found in the main jnlp file, will be
passed as arguments to the invoking VM (-Dname=value).</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">The list of  &ldquo;secure&rdquo;
properties for this version can be found in  the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/syntax.html">Developer's

</P>
<P><A NAME="220"></A><B>What causes the file not found message for
the downloaded jnlp file?</B></P>
<P>You click on a jnlp file, and Internet Explorer downloads the file,
then launches Java Web Start, but you get the message: &ldquo;Could
not load file/URL specified: C:\Documents and
Settings\...\application[1].jnlp&rdquo;.</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">This problem is specific to Internet Explorer. Although this can  be caused by
a full cache, or turning off the cache in IE, it is usually caused by
a no-cache directive coming from either the web server or the proxy
server.  IE will honor this directive, and not write the jnlp file to
disk, so Java Web Start cannot find it.  This frequently happens when
upgrading a tomcat based server.  Later versions set the no-cache
directive by default for any resource that is within a
</SPAN>security-constraint in web.xml.   Try taking the relevant URI
out of the security constraint in web.xml. </A></SPAN><B><BR></B><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A>

<P><A NAME="221"></A><B>How can I use signed jars (such as JCE
extensions) signed for other purposes?</B></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Beginning with Java Web Start
1.5.0, you can multiply sign the jar, adding code signing
certificates over another existing certificate chain.  With previous
versions, you would either have to run the jar as a component
extension w/o all-permissions, or strip the existing certificates
before adding code signing certificates. (which in many cases
rendered the package inoperable.)</SPAN><B><BR></B><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back

<P><A NAME="225"></A><B>How are Applications uniquely identified?</B></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">An application is normally
identified by it's href (the url to it's jnlp file.)  If there is no
href to the jnlp file, it is identified by the href to it's main jar
file.  If multiple applications share the same main jar file, they
must contain an href, or they will be treated as the same app.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">In version 1.5.0 and beyond, the
Java Application Cache Viewer, will show all applications, even those
w/o an href.  The Viewer can only launch an application online, if it
has an href.  Without an href, it can launch offline if the jnlp file
allows (contains &lt;offline-allowed&gt;)</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">In previous versions, the
Application Manager will only show those applications with an href.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">The same thing applies to
creating shortcuts.  In 1.5.0 you can only create a shortcut to
launch online if there is an href, and can only create an offline
shortcut if &lt;offline-allowed&gt; is specified.  In 1.4.2, you can
only create shortcuts to applications with an href.<BR></SPAN><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back

it's recommended that you use multiple association tags.
Also, both the file-extension and mime-type must be specified for each

<H2>Security Questions</H2>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<P><A NAME="301"></A><B>How secure is Java Web Start?</B> 
</P>
<P>Security is a key consideration of the Java Web Start design.&nbsp;
In Java Web Start all applications are launched by default in a
secure &quot;sandbox.&quot; <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to
top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="302"></A><B>What is a secure sandbox?</B> 
</P>
<P>Applications in the secure sandbox have restricted access to local
computing resources such as the disk and network. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back
to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="303"></A><B>How is the Java Web Start secure sandbox more
flexible than the applet sandbox?</B> 
</P>
<P>All applications, by default, are run in a sandboxed environment,
similar to the applet sandbox. However, Java Web Start provides a
secure API that enables an application to import and export files
from the local disk under the user's control. The API includes dialog
boxes for operations such as saving a file and opening a file that
are actually rendered by Java Web Start, and not by the application
itself. 
</P>
<P>This sandbox design is similar to what you can do with HTML. A
file input field in an HTML form enables a user to pick a file from
the local disk and submit the name (excluding path) and content&nbsp;
to the web server. Similarly, most browsers support the 'Save as...'
option. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="304"></A><B>How can I enable my application to gain
unrestricted access to the system?</B> 
</P>
<P>An application requesting unrestricted system access must be
digitally signed. The first time a user launches such an application,
a security dialog box will appear. Before running the application,
Java Web Start will prompt the user to accept the digital
certificate. After the user has accepted the certificate, subsequent
invocations will not show the security dialog box. <BR><A HREF="#top"><FONT SIZE=2>Back
to top</FONT></A> 
</P>
<P><A NAME="305"></A><B>Is there support for encrypted download of
JAR files?</B> 
</P>
<P>Support for encrypting data transferred from the server to the
client is very important. This is an important point on our issue
list, and we will definitely make sure that HTTPS libraries will work
with applications that are launched with Java Web Start. The HTTPS
support might be in an optional package that you need to specify that
your application depends on. 
</P>
<P>Encrypting the JAR files transferred from the server to the client
may not be necessary. The reason is, even if the class files where
encrypted on the wire, they will have to be decrypted on the client
side and stored to disk, so the JVM will be able to load the classes.
Thus, it could be fairly simple for a cracker to get around the
encryption of the JAR files. 
</P>
<P>Instead, what is important for JAR files is that they can be
signed, so the user can be absolutely sure that the application is
from the vendor he expect it to be from. This is already supported.

<P>NTLM support was added to Java 1.4.2 on Windows platforms only. 
You can use NTLM authentication with Java Web Start in 1.4.2 and
