rmic - The Java RMI Compiler</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>rmic</B> generates stub, skeleton, and tie classes for
remote objects using either the JRMP or IIOP protocols. Also
generates OMG IDL.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>
SYNOPSIS</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>rmic [ <A HREF="rmic.html#Options">options</A> ] <I>package-qualified-class-name(s)</I></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>
DESCRIPTION</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The <B>rmic</B> compiler generates stub and skeleton class
files (JRMP protocol) and stub and tie class files (IIOP protocol) for
remote objects. These classes files are generated from compiled
Java programming language classes that are remote object implementation
classes. A remote implementation class is a class that implements the interface
<TT>java.rmi.Remote</TT>.  The class names in the <B>rmic</B> command
must be for classes that have been compiled successfully with the
<B>javac</B> command and must be fully package qualified. For example,
running <B>rmic</B> on the class file name <TT>HelloImpl</TT> as shown
here:  <PRE>rmic hello.HelloImpl</PRE> creates the
<TT>HelloImpl_Stub.class</TT> file
in the <tt>hello</tt> subdirectory (named for the class's package).

<P>A <i>skeleton</i> for a remote object is a JRMP protocol server-side
entity that has a method that dispatches calls to the actual
remote object implementation.

<p> A <i>tie</i> for a remote object is a server-side entity similar to
a skeleton, but which communicates with the client using the IIOP
protocol.

<P>A <i>stub</i> is a client-side proxy for a remote object which is responsible
for communicating method invocations on remote objects to the server where
the actual remote object implementation resides. A client's reference
to a remote object, therefore, is actually a reference to a local stub.

<p>By default, <B>rmic</B> generates stub classes that use the 1.2
JRMP stub protocol version only, as if the <a
href="#v1.2"><tt>-v1.2</tt> option</a> had been specified.  (Note that
the <a href="#vcompat"><tt>-vcompat</tt> option</a> was the default in
releases prior to 1.5.)  Use the <a href="#iiop"><code>-iiop</code>
option</a> to generate stub and tie classes for the IIOP protocol.

<P>A stub implements only the remote interfaces, not any local
interfaces that the remote object also implements.  Because a JRMP
stub implements the same set of remote interfaces as the remote object
itself, a client can use the Java programming language's built-in
operators for casting and type checking.  For IIOP, the
<tt>PortableRemoteObject.narrow</tt> method must be used.

OPTIONS</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>

<DT>
<B>-bootclasspath path</B></DT>
<DD>
Overrides location of bootstrap class files</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<B>-classpath path</B></DT>

<DD>
Specifies the path <B>rmic</B> uses to look up classes. This option overrides
the default or the CLASSPATH environment variable if it is set. Directories
are separated by colons. Thus the general format for <I>path</I> is:</DD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>.:&lt;your_path></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>.:/usr/local/java/classes</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<DT>
<B>-d directory</B></DT>

<DD>
Specifies the root destination directory for the generated class
hierarchy. You can use this option to specify a destination directory
for the stub, skeleton, and tie files. For example, the command</DD>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>% rmic -d /java/classes foo.MyClass</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

would place the stub and skeleton classes derived from
<code>MyClass</code> into the directory <TT>/java/classes/foo</TT>.
If the <TT>-d</TT> option is not specified, the default behavior is as
if <tt>"-d&nbsp;."</tt> were specified: the package hierarchy of the target class is
created in the current directory, and stub/tie/skeleton files are
placed within it. (Note that in some previous versions of <b>rmic</b>, if
<tt>-d</tt> was not specified, then the package hierarchy was <i>not</i>
created, and all of the output files were placed directly in the current
directory.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<DT>
<B>-extdirs path</B></DT>        

<DD>Overrides location of installed extensions</DD>

<p>
<DT>
<B>-g</B></DT>

<DD>
Enables generation of all debugging information, including local variables.
By default, only line number information is generated.</DD>

<p>

<a name="idl"></a>
<dt>
<b>-idl</b></dt>
<dd>
Causes <TT>rmic</TT> to generate OMG IDL for the classes specified and
any classes referenced.  IDL provides a purely declarative, programming
language-independent way of specifying an object's API.  The IDL is
used as a specification for methods and data that can be written in and
invoked from any language that provides CORBA bindings.  This includes
Java and C++ among others.  See the <a
href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/java_language_mapping_to_omg_idl.htm"> Java Language to
IDL Mapping</a> (OMG) document for a complete description.
<p>
When the <code>-idl</code> option is used, other options also
include:</DD><p>
<dl>
	<dt> <b>-always</b> or <b>-alwaysgenerate</b></dt> <dd> Forces
	re-generation even when existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer than
	the input class. 
	</dd>

	<dt> <b>-factory</b></dt> <dd> Uses factory keyword in
	generated IDL.
	</dd>

	<dt> <b>-idlModule&nbsp; fromJavaPackage[.class]&nbsp;
	toIDLModule</b></dt> <dd> Specifies IDLEntity package
	mapping. For example:&nbsp; <tt>-idlModule foo.bar
	my::real::idlmod</tt>.
	</dd>

	<dt> <b>-idlFile&nbsp; fromJavaPackage[.class]&nbsp;
	toIDLFile</b></dt> <dd> Specifies IDLEntity file mapping.
	For example:&nbsp; <tt>-idlFile test.pkg.X
	TEST16.idl</tt>.&nbsp; 	</dd>

</dl>

<p>

<a name="iiop"></a>
<dt>
<b>-iiop</b></dt>
<dd>
Causes <code>rmic</code> to generate IIOP stub and tie classes, rather
than JRMP stub and skeleton classes.  A stub class is a local proxy for
a remote object and is used by clients to send calls to a server.
Each remote interface requires a stub class, which implements that
remote interface.  A client's reference to a remote object is actually
a reference to a stub. Tie classes are used on the server side to
process incoming calls, and dispatch the calls to the proper
implementation class. Each implementation class requires a tie class.
<p>
Invoking <tt>rmic</tt> with the <tt>-iiop</tt> generates
stubs and ties that conform to this naming convention:

<blockquote>
<pre>
_&lt;implementationName&gt;_stub.class
<br>
_&lt;interfaceName&gt;_tie.class
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
When the <code>-iiop</code> option is used, other options also
include:</DD><p>
<dl>
	<dt> <b>-always</b> or <b>-alwaysgenerate</b></dt> <dd> Forces
	re-generation even when existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer than
	the input class. 
	</dd>

	<DT><B>-nolocalstubs</B></DT>
	<dd>
	Do not create stubs optimized for same-process clients and
	servers.
	</dd>

	<dt>
	<b>-noValueMethods</b></dt>
	<dd>
	Must be used with the <code>-idl</code> option.  Prevents
	addition of <tt>valuetype</tt> methods and initializers to
	emitted IDL.  These methods and initializers are optional for
	<tt>valuetype</tt>s, and are generated unless the
	<tt>-noValueMethods</tt> option is specified when using the
	<tt>-idl</tt> option.</dd>
	
	<DT><B>-poa</B></DT>
	<dd>Changes the inheritance from
	<tt>org.omg.CORBA_2_3.portable.ObjectImpl</tt> to
	<tt>org.omg.PortableServer.Servant</tt>.

 	<P>The <tt>PortableServer</tt> module for the <a href="../../guide/idl/POA.html">Portable Object Adapter</a>
 	(POA) defines
 	the native <tt>Servant</tt> type. In the Java programming language,
 	the <tt>Servant</tt>
 	type is mapped to the Java <tt>org.omg.PortableServer.Servant</tt> class.  It
 	serves as the base class for all POA servant implementations and
 	provides a number of methods that may be invoked by the application
 	programmer, as well as methods which are invoked by the POA itself and
 	may be overridden by the user to control aspects of servant behavior.
 	Based on the OMG IDL to Java Language Mapping Specification, CORBA V
	2.3.1 ptc/00-01-08.pdf.

</dl>

<p>
<DT>
<B>-J</B></DT>

<DD>
Used in conjunction with any <tt>java</tt> option, it passes the option
following the <TT>-J</TT> (no spaces between the -J and the option) on
to the <tt>java</tt> interpreter.</DD>

<p>

<DT>
<B>-keep</b> or <B>-keepgenerated</B></DT>

<DD>
Retains the generated <TT>.java</TT> source files for the stub,
skeleton, and/or tie classes and writes them to the same directory as
the <TT>.class</TT> files.</DD>

<p>

<DT>
<B>-nowarn</B></DT>

<DD>
Turns off warnings. If used the compiler does not print out any warnings.</DD>

<p>

<a name="vcompat"></a>
<DT>
<B>-vcompat</B></DT>

<DD>
Generates stub and skeleton classes compatible with both the 1.1 and
1.2 JRMP stub protocol versions. (This option was the default in
releases prior to 1.5.)  The generated stub classes will use the 1.1 stub
protocol version when loaded in a JDK 1.1 virtual machine and will use
the 1.2 stub protocol version when loaded into a 1.2 (or later)
virtual machine.  The generated skeleton classes will support both 1.1
and 1.2 stub protocol versions.  The generated classes are relatively
large in order to support both modes of operation.</DD>

<p>

<DT>
<B>-verbose</B></DT>

<DD>
Causes the compiler and linker to print out messages about what classes
are being compiled and what class files are being loaded.</DD>

<p>

<a name="v1.1"></a>
<DT>
<B>-v1.1</B></DT>

<DD>
Generates stub and skeleton classes for the 1.1 JRMP stub protocol
version only.  Note that this option is only useful for generating
stub classes that are serialization-compatible with pre-existing,
statically-deployed stub classes that were generated by the
<b>rmic</b> tool from JDK 1.1 and that cannot be upgraded (and dynamic
class loading is not being used).</DD>

<p>

<a name="v1.2"></a>
<DT>
<B>-v1.2</B></DT>

<DD>
(default) Generates stub classes for the 1.2 JRMP stub protocol
version only.  No skeleton classes are generated with this option
because skeleton classes are not used with the 1.2 stub protocol
version.  The generated stub classes will not work if they are loaded
into a JDK 1.1 virtual machine.</DD>
