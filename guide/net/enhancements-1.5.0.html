  <li>Complete support for IPv6 on Windows XP (SP1) and 2003 server has been provided 
    in this release. (4608529)</li>
  <li> The networking API now provides a way of setting timeouts on connect and 
    read operations for protocol handlers. This will benefit any HTTP client application 
    that must behave robustly in the event of server failure. (4700777)</li>

    to be launched via <code>inetd</code>. (4295885, 4673940)</li>

    for the reachability of a host. This features provides a ping-like capability 
    in Java. (4639861)</li>
  <li>Cookie support has been improved. Applications and web containers can provide 
    Cookie management by implementing the new <code>CookieHandler</code> API. 
    (4696506)</li>
  <li>Proxy server configuration has been improved. It can now be dynamic and 
    controlable by web containers and applications through the <code>ProxySelector</code> 
    API, which can also handle failures to connect to the proxy. (4696512)</li>
  <li>A new framework provides a way for protocol handlers to access a file caching 
    mechanism implemented by the platform or by a third party. (4837267)</li>
  <li>The specification of the URL class now mandates a minimum set of URL protocol 
    handlers that are guaranteed to be present in J2SE. They are http, https, 
    file, jar and ftp. (4180636)</li>
  <li> There have been a number of enhancements for JSSE (SSL/TLS). For more information,
