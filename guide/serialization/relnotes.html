<dt><b>Support for deserialization of unshared objects (since 1.4)</b></dt>
<dd>Serialization now provides extra support for deserialization of 
objects which are known to be unshared in the data-serialization 
stream.  The new support is provided by the following API additions 
in package <tt>java.io</tt>:
<blockquote>
<font size="-1">
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#readUnshared()">
<tt>ObjectInputStream.readUnshared()</tt></a><p>
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectOutputStream.html#writeUnshared(java.lang.Object)"><tt>ObjectOutputStream.writeUnshared(Object obj)</tt></a><p>
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectStreamField.html#ObjectStreamField(java.lang.String, java.lang.Class, boolean)"><tt>ObjectStreamField(String name, 
Class type, boolean unshared)</tt></a>
</font>
</blockquote>
    Previously, security-conscious programmers had to clone private internal
    objects after deserializing them to guard against the possibility that
    outside parties with access to the serialization stream could append
    spurious back handles to the sensitive objects, resulting in extra
    references to them during deserialization.  However, this solution slows
    performance and wastes memory -- two objects must be created and a copy
    operation invoked in order to ensure a unique reference to a single usable
    object.  The new API additions provide a more efficient solution by
    allowing receivers to invalidate "unshared" objects as they are read in,
    making it impossible for third parties to dereference back-handles to those
    objects occurring later in the stream.
</dd>
<p>

<dt><b>Security permissions now required to override putFields, readFields (since 1.4)</b></dt>
<dd>
Beginning with J2SE 1.4.0, ObjectOutputStream's 
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectOutputStream.html#ObjectOutputStream(java.io.OutputStream)">public one-argument constructor</a> requires the
"enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission when invoked
(either directly or indirectly) by a subclass which overrides
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectOutputStream.html#putFields()"><tt>ObjectOutputStream.putFields</tt></a> or <a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectOutputStream.html#writeUnshared(java.lang.Object)"><tt>ObjectOutputStream.writeUnshared</tt></a>.
<p>
Also beginning with J2SE 1.4.0, ObjectInputStream's 
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#ObjectInputStream(java.io.InputStream)">public one-argument constructor</a> requires the
"enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission when invoked
(either directly or indirectly) by a subclass which overrides
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#readFields()"><tt>ObjectInputStream.readFields</tt></a> or <a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#readUnshared()"><tt>ObjectInputStream.readUnshared</tt></a>.
<p>
These changes will not affect the great majority of applications. 
However, it will affect any ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream
subclasses which override the <tt>putFields</tt> or <tt>readFields</tt> 
methods without also overriding the rest of the serialization infrastructure.
</dd>
<p>

<dt><b>Support for class-defined readObjectNoData method (since 1.4)</b></dt>
<dd>
In addition to supporting class-defined <tt>writeObject()</tt> 
and <tt>readObject()</tt>
methods, serialization now includes support for class-defined
<tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> methods.  Each class-defined 
<tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> method is required to have 
the following signature:
<font size="-1">
<blockquote><pre>
private void readObjectNoData() throws ObjectStreamException;
</pre></blockquote>
</font>
The <tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> method is analogous to the class-defined 
<tt>readObject()</tt> method, except that (if defined) it is called in 
cases where the class descriptor for a superclass of the object being 
deserialized (and hence the object data described by that class descriptor) 
is not present in the serialization stream. More formally: 
<blockquote>
      If object O of class C is being deserialized, and S is a superclass of C
      in the VM which is deserializing O, then <tt>S.readObjectNoData()</tt> 
      is invoked by ObjectInputStream during the deserialization of O if 
      and only if the following conditions are true:
<ol>
        <li>  S implements java.io.Serializable (directly or indirectly).

        <li>  S defines an <tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> method with 
          the signature listed above.

        <li>  The serialization stream containing O does not include a class
            descriptor for S among its list of superclass descriptors for C.
</ol>
</blockquote>
Note that <tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> is never invoked in cases 
where a class-defined <tt>readObject()</tt> method could be called, 
though serializable class implementors can call 
<tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> from within <tt>readObject()</tt> as a 
means of consolidating initialization code.

<dt><b>Bug fix: Deserialization fails for Class object of primitive type (since 1.4)</b></dt>
<dd>
In previous releases, bug <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4171142.html">4171142</a> caused attempts 
to deserialize Class objects of primitive types to fail with a 
<tt>ClassNotFoundException</tt>.  The problem was that 
<tt>ObjectInputStream.resolveClass()</tt> did not work for 
ObjectStreamClass descriptors for primitive types.  This bug 
is fixed in J2SE 1.4.0.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Bug fix: ObjectInputStream.resolveProxyClass can fail for non-public
  interface cases (since 1.4)</b></dt>
<dd>
In previous releases, <a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#resolveProxyClass(java.lang.String[])"><tt>ObjectInputStream.resolveProxyClass</tt></a> would not always
select the proper class loader to define the proxy class in if one or more
of the proxy interfaces were non-public.  In this release,
if <tt>ObjectInputStream.resolveProxyClass</tt> detects a non-public interface, it
attempts to define the implementing proxy class in the same class loader as
the interface (barring conflicts, in which case an exception is thrown),
which is necessary in order for the proxy to implement the interface.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Bug fix: Invalid serialPersistentFields field name causes
  NullPointerException (since 1.4)</b></dt>
<dd>In previous releases, bug <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4387368.html">4387368</a> caused NullPointerExceptions to be thrown
when serializing objects which used default serialization but also declared
serialPersistentField entries which did not map to actual class fields.
Serialization will now throw InvalidClassExceptions in such cases (since it
is never necessary to define such "unbacked" serialPersistentFields when
using default serialization).
</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Bug fix: ClassNotFoundException in skipped objects causes 
serialization to fail (since 1.4)</b></dt>
<dd>In previous releases, ClassNotFoundExceptions triggered by "skipped"
objects--objects associated with fields not present in the classes loaded
by the deserializing party--would cause deserialization of the entire
object graph to fail, even though the skipped values would not be included
in the graph.  This release of serialization addresses this problem by
ignoring ClassNotFoundExceptions associated with such skipped objects, thus
eliminating a class of unnecessary deserialization errors.  Other
miscellaneous changes have also been made to improve the overall robustness
of serialization with regards to ClassNotFoundExceptions encountered during
deserialization.
</dd>
</dl>



<dl>
<dt>
<B>Strings longer than 64K can now be serialized (since 1.3)</B></dt>

<dd>Prior to 1.3, an attempt to serialize a string longer than 64K
would result in a <code>java.io.UTFDataFormatException</code> being
thrown.  In 1.3, the serialization protocol has been enhanced to allow
strings longer than 64K to be serialized.  Note that if a 1.2 (or earlier) 
JVM attempts to read a long string written from a 1.3-compatible JVM, 
the 1.2 (or earlier) JVM will receive a
<code>java.io.StreamCorruptedException</code>.</dd>
<p>
<dt>
<B>Serialization performance enhancements (since 1.3)</B></dt>
<dd>Several changes have been made to serialization to improve overall performance:
<ul>
<li>UTF string reads/writes have been optimized to reduce unnecessary memory
      allocation and synchronization/method call overhead.
<li>Code for reading and writing primitive data arrays has been streamlined.
      Float and double array reads/writes have been reimplemented to minimize
      the number of calls to native methods.
<li>Internal buffering has been improved.
<li>Reflective operations for getting/setting primitive field values have been
      batched to minimize the number of separate native method calls.
</ul>
</dd>
<p>
<dt>
<B>Improved exception reporting (since 1.3)</B></dt>

<dd>If a class cannot be found during the class resolution process of
deserialization, the original
<code>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException</code> is thrown instead of a
generic one so that more information about the failure is available.
Also, deserialization exception reporting now includes
maintaining the name of the original class that could not be found
instead of reporting a higher-level class that was being deserialized.
For example, if (in an RMI call) the stub class <i>can</i> be found but
the remote interface class cannot, the serialization mechanism will now
report correctly that the interface class was the class that could not
be found instead of erroneously reporting that the stub class could not
be found.
</dd><p>
<dt>
<B><code>java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeClassDescriptor</code>,<br>
<code>java.io.ObjectInputStream.readClassDescriptor</code> (since 1.3)</B></dt>
<dd>

The <code>writeClassDescriptor</code> and <code>readClassDescriptor</code> methods have been added to
provide a means of customizing the serialized representation of
<code>java.io.ObjectStreamClass</code> class descriptors.  <code>writeClassDescriptor</code> is called
when an instance of <code>java.io.ObjectStreamClass</code> needs to be serialized, and is
responsible for writing the <code>ObjectStreamClass</code> to the serialization stream.
Conversely, <code>readClassDescriptor</code> is called when the <code>ObjectInputStream</code> expects an
<code>ObjectStreamClass</code> instance as the next item in the serialization stream.  By
overriding these methods, subclasses of <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> and <code>ObjectInputStream</code>
can transmit class descriptors in an application-specific format.  For more
information, refer to sections 2.1 and 3.1 of the <i>Java Object Serialization
Specification</i>.
</dd><p><dt>
<B><code>java.io.ObjectOutputStream.annotateProxyClass</code>,<br>
<code>java.io.ObjectInputStream.resolveProxyClass</code> (since 1.3)</B></dt>
<dd>

These methods are similar in purpose to <code>ObjectOutputStream.annotateClass</code> and
<code>ObjectInputStream.resolveClass</code>, except that they apply to dynamic proxy classes
(see <code>java.lang.reflect.Proxy</code>), as opposed to non-proxy classes.  Subclasses of
<code>ObjectOutputStream</code> may override <code>annotateProxyClass</code> to store custom data in the
stream along with descriptors for dynamic proxy classes.  <code>ObjectInputStream</code>
subclasses may then override <code>resolveProxyClass</code> to make use of the custom data in
selecting a local class to associate with the given proxy class descriptor.  For
details, see section 4 of the <i>Java Object Serialization Specification</i>.
</dd><p>
<dt>
<B>The javadoc tool tags <code>@serial</code>, <code>@serialField</code>, and <code>@serialData</code> (since 1.2)</B></dt>
<dd>

The javadoc tags <code>@serial</code>, <code>@serialField</code>, and <code>@serialData</code> have been added to
provide a way to document the serialized form of a class.  Javadoc generates a
serialization specification based on the contents of these tags.  For details,
refer to section 1.6 of the <i>Java Object Serialization Specification</i>.
</dd><p>
<dt>
<B>Protocol versioning (since 1.2)</B></dt>
<dd>
Prior to 1.2, object serialization used a protocol that did not support skipping
over objects implementing the <code>java.io.Externalizable</code> interface if the classes
for those objects were not available.  In 1.2, a new protocol version was added
which addressed this deficiency.  For backwards compatibility,
<code>ObjectOutputStream</code> and <code>ObjectInputStream</code> can read and write serialization
streams written in either protocol; the protocol version used can be selected by
calling the <code>ObjectOutputStream.useProtocolVersion</code> method.  For details and a
discussion of compatibility issues, see section 6.3 of the <i>Java Object
Serialization Specification</i>.
</dd><p>
<dt>
<B>Class-defined <code>writeReplace</code> and <code>readResolve</code> methods (since 1.2)</B></dt>
<dd>
Since 1.2, classes can define <code>writeReplace</code> and <code>readResolve</code> methods which allow
instances of the given classes to nominate replacements for themselves during
serialization and deserialization.  The required signatures of these methods,
along with further details, are described in sections 2.5 and 3.6 of the <i>Java
Object Serialization Specification</i>.
</dd><p>
<dt>
<B><code>
java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeObjectOverride</code>,
<code>java.io.ObjectInputStream.readObjectOverride</code> (since 1.2)</B></dt>
<dd>
Since 1.2, subclasses of <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> and <code>ObjectInputStream</code> can implement
a custom serialization protocol by overriding the <code>writeObjectOverride</code> and
<code>readObjectOverride</code> methods.  Note that these methods will only be called if the
<code>ObjectOutputStream/ObjectInputStream</code> subclasses possess the permission
<code>java.io.SerializablePermission("enableSubclassImplementation")</code>, and call the
no-argument constructors of <code>ObjectOutputStream/ObjectInputStream</code>.  See sections
2.1 and 3.1 of the <i>Java Object Serialization Specification</i> for more information.
</dd>
<p>
<dt>
<B>Security permission checks (since 1.2)</B></dt>
<dd>
Subclasses of <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> and <code>ObjectInputStream</code> may override inherited
methods to obtain "hooks" into certain aspects of the serialization process.
Since 1.2, object serialization uses the 1.2 security model to verify that
subclasses possess adequate permissions to override certain hooks.
The permissions <code>java.io.SerializablePermission("enableSubclassImplementation</code>") and
<code>java.io.SerializablePermission("enableSubstitution</code>") govern whether or not the methods
<code>ObjectOutputStream.writeObjectOverride</code>, <code>ObjectOutputStream.replaceObject</code>,
<code>ObjectInputStream.readObjectOverride</code>, and <code>ObjectInputStream.resolveObject</code>
will be called during the course of serialization.  See sections 2.1 and 3.1 of
the <i>Java Object Serialization Specifications</i> for more information.
</dd><p>
<dt>
<B>Defining serializable fields for a class (since 1.2)</B></dt>
<dd>

By default, the values of all non-static and non-transient fields of a
serializable class are written when an instance of that class is
serialized.  In 1.2, a new mechanism was introduced to allow classes finer
control of this process.  By declaring a special field <code>serialPersistentFields</code>,
serializable classes can dictate which fields will be written when instances of
the class (or subclasses) are serialized.  This feature also enables classes to
"define" serializable fields which do not correspond directly to actual fields
in the class.  Used in conjunction with the serializable fields API (described
below), this capability allows fields to be added or removed from a class
without altering the serialized representation of the class.  See sections 1.5
and 1.7 of the <i>Java Object Serialization Specification</i> for details.
</dd><p>
<dt>
<B>Serializable fields API (since 1.2)</B></dt>
<dd>
Introduced in 1.2, the serializable fields API allows class-defined
<code>writeObject</code>/<code>readObject</code> methods to explicitly set and retrieve serializable
field values by name and type.  This API is particularly useful for classes
that need to maintain backwards compatibility with older class versions; in
some cases, the older version of the class may have defined a set of
serializable fields that cannot be mapped directly to the fields of the current
class.  In this case, newer versions of the class can define custom
<code>writeObject</code> and <code>readObject</code> methods that convert the internal state of a
given instance of the (new) class into the "old" serialized form, and vice
versa.  For more information, see section 1.7 of the <i>Java Object Serialization Specification</i>.
