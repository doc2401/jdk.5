<p>When you take an element out of a <code>Collection</code>, you must
cast it to the type of element that is stored in the collection.
Besides being inconvenient, this is unsafe.  The compiler does not
check that your cast is the same as the collection's type, so the cast
can fail at run time.

<p>Generics provides a way for you to communicate the type of a
collection to the compiler, so that it can be checked.  Once the
compiler knows the element type of the collection, the compiler can
check that you have used the collection consistently and can insert
the correct casts on values being taken out of the collection.

<p>
Here is a simple example taken from the existing Collections tutorial:
<blockquote>
<pre><b>// Removes 4-letter words from c. <font color="#cc0000">Elements must be strings</font></b>
static void expurgate(Collection c) {
    for (Iterator i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
      if (<font color="#cc0000">((String) i.next())</font>.length() == 4)
        i.remove();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the same example modified to use generics:
<blockquote>
<pre><a name=expurgate><b>// Removes the 4-letter words from c</b></a>
static void expurgate(Collection<font color="#009900">&lt;String&gt;</font> c) {
    for (Iterator<font color="#009900">&lt;String&gt;</font> i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
      if (<font color="#009900">i.next()</font>.length() == 4)
        i.remove();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>When you see the code <code>&lt;Type&gt;</code>, read it as &#8220;of <code>Type</code>&#8221;; the declaration above reads as &#8220;<code>Collection</code> of <code>String c</code>.&#8221
The code using generics is clearer and safer.  We have eliminated an
unsafe cast and a number of extra parentheses.  More importantly,
we have moved part of the specification of the method from a
comment to its signature, so the compiler can verify at compile time
that the type constraints are not violated at run time.
Because the program compiles without warnings, we can state with
certainty that it will not throw a <code>ClassCastException</code> at run time.
The net effect of using generics, especially in large programs, is improved
readability and robustness.

<p>To paraphrase Generics Specification Lead Gilad Bracha, when we declare
<code>c</code> to be of type <code>Collection&lt;String&gt;</code>, this tells us
something about the variable <code>c</code> that holds true wherever and whenever
it is used, and the compiler guarantees it (assuming the program compiles
without warnings).  A cast, on the other hand, tells us something the
programmer thinks is true at a single point in the code, and the VM checks
whether the programmer is right only at run time.

<p>While the primary use of generics is collections, there are many
other uses. &#8220;Holder classes,&#8221; such as
<a href="../../api/java/lang/ref/WeakReference.html"><code>WeakReference</code></a>
and <a href="../../api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html"><code>ThreadLocal</code></a>,
have all been <i>generified</i>, that is, they have been retrofitted to
make use of generics.  More surprisingly, class 
<a href="../../api/java/lang/Class.html"><code>Class</code></a> has been
generified. Class literals now function as <i>type tokens</i>, providing both
run-time and compile-time type information. This enables a style of static
factories exemplified by the <code>getAnnotation</code> method in the new
<a href="../../api/java/lang/reflect/AnnotatedElement.html"><code>AnnotatedElement</code></a> interface:
<pre>    &lt;T extends Annotation&gt; T getAnnotation(Class&lt;T&gt; annotationType); </pre>

This is a <t>generic method</t>.  It infers the value of its <i>type
parameter</i> <code>T</code> from its argument, and returns an appropriate
instance of <code>T</code>, as illustrated by the following snippet:

<pre>    Author a = Othello.class.getAnnotation(Author.class);
</pre>
Prior to generics, you would have had to cast the result to
<code>Author</code>.  Also you would have had no way to make the compiler check
that the actual parameter represented a subclass of <code>Annotation</code>.

<p>Generics are implemented by <i>type erasure</i>: generic type
information is present only at compile time, after which it is
<i>erased</i> by the compiler. The main advantage of this approach is
that it provides total interoperability between generic code and
legacy code that uses non-parameterized types (which are technically
known as <i>raw</i> types). The main disadvantages are that parameter
type information is not available at run time, and that automatically
generated casts may fail when interoperating with ill-behaved legacy code.
There is, however, a way to achieve guaranteed run-time type safety for
generic collections even when interoperating with ill-behaved legacy code.

<p>The <code>java.util.Collections</code> class has been outfitted with
wrapper classes that provide guaranteed run-time type safety. They are
similar in structure to the synchronized and unmodifiable
wrappers. These &#8220;checked collection wrappers&#8221; are very
useful for debugging. Suppose you have a set of strings, <code>s</code>,
into which some legacy code is mysteriously inserting an
integer. Without the wrapper, you will not find out about the problem
until you read the problem element from the set, and an automatically
generated cast to <code>String</code> fails. At this point, it is too late
to determine the source of the problem. If, however, you replace the
declaration:

<pre>    Set&lt;String&gt; s = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;();
</string></string></pre>
with this declaration:
<pre>    Set&lt;String&gt; s = Collections.checkedSet(new HashSet&lt;String&gt;(), String.class);
</string></pre>

the collection will throw a <code>ClassCastException</code> at the point
where the legacy code attempts to insert the integer. The resulting
stack trace will allow you to diagnose and repair the problem.

<p>You should use generics everywhere you can. The extra effort in
generifying code is well worth the gains in clarity and type safety.
It is straightforward to use a generic library, but it requires some
expertise to write a generic library, or to generify an existing library.
There is one caveat: You may not use generics (or any other Tiger
features) if you intend to deploy the compiled code on a pre-5.0
virtual machine.

<p>If you are familiar with C++'s <i>template</i> mechanism, you might
think that generics are similar, but the similarity is
superficial.  Generics do not generate a new class for each specialization, nor do they permit &#8220;template metaprogramming.&#8221;

<p>There is much more to learn about generics. See the
